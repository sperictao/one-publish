- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Phase 7 added streaming logs, cancellation, and snapshot export. Users still lack a persistent run timeline to quickly review recent execution outcomes.

## Goals

- Persist recent provider execution records locally
- Keep execution history bounded and lightweight
- Surface recent history in UI for quick status inspection

## Non-Goals

- Full-text log indexing/search
- Cloud sync of run history

## Delivered

- Added persistent `execution_history` state in backend store
  - stores run metadata (`provider`, `project`, `started/finished`, `status`, `output/error`, `command`)
  - keeps only latest 20 records (bounded list)
- Added Tauri commands for history operations
  - `get_execution_history`
  - `add_execution_record`
- Integrated history write path in frontend publish flow
  - appends one record for each run outcome (success/fail/cancel)
- Added UI history panel
  - shows recent records with provider, status, project path, and finish time
  - supports quick visual triage for recent runs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Execution records are persisted locally and survive restart
- [x] AC2: Only the latest 20 records are retained
- [x] AC3: User can view recent run statuses in UI
