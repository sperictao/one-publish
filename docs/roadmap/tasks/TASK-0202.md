## Context

Provider registry is in place (TASK-0201). Next we add a Rust provider that can publish/build Rust projects.
The first slice is compiling a spec into an execution plan (no execution engine overhaul yet).

## Goals

- Add provider id `cargo` with a manifest.
- Compile a minimal `cargo` spec into one `cargo build` step.

## Non-Goals

- Full cargo feature coverage.
- Detecting workspace/package targets.

## Requirements

- R1: `provider_id = "cargo"` resolves.
- R2: Compiling a cargo spec produces a single step `cargo.build`.

## Technical Design

- Add `CargoProvider` and register it in the registry.
- Step payload should include `project_path` and `parameters`.

## TDD Plan

- [ ] Registry resolves `cargo`.
- [ ] Compiler produces `cargo.build` for cargo specs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` passes.
