Status: done

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Issue drafts are now copy-ready, but teams need consistent structure variations for bug/incidence/postmortem contexts.

## Goals

- Support template variables for issue drafts (provider/signature/frequency/command)
- Provide reusable optional sections (impact, workaround, owner)
- Keep generated markdown deterministic and easy to review

## Non-Goals

- Full markdown editor
- Remote template sync

## Delivered

- Extended issue draft generator with template variants
  - supports `bug`/`incident`/`postmortem` summary structures
  - keeps core sections deterministic (summary/command/occurrences/follow-up)
- Added reusable optional sections
  - supports toggling `Impact`/`Workaround`/`Owner` placeholders
  - preserves markdown readability for direct copy into issue trackers
- Added template controls in failure drill-down panel
  - supports selecting template variant and toggling optional sections before copy
  - reuses existing one-click `复制 Issue 草稿` action flow
- Expanded unit tests for template + optional section generation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can choose template variant when generating draft
- [x] AC2: Draft resolves variables from selected failure group data
- [x] AC3: Optional sections can be toggled without breaking core structure
