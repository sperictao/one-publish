Status: done

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Manual export and copying still requires repeated clicks for daily triage rituals.

## Goals

- Add preset action for daily triage export workflow
- Bundle common filters + export format defaults
- Keep workflow one-click from history panel

## Non-Goals

- Background automation engine
- External notifications

## Delivered

- Added daily-triage preset model and local persistence
  - stores provider/status/window/keyword/export format and enabled flag in local settings
  - keeps deterministic default as `failed + 24h + csv` for daily failure triage
- Added one-click daily triage export action in history panel
  - new `一键导出日报` action applies preset filters and directly enters export flow
  - export format is enforced by preset to keep output deterministic
- Refactored history filtering into shared pure function
  - same filter logic now powers both interactive history panel and triage export path
  - reduces duplicated filter rules and avoids preset drift
- Added inline preset editor + enable/disable controls
  - supports editing provider/status/window/keyword/format locally
  - supports instant disable without deleting configuration
- Added unit tests for daily triage preset persistence and fallback behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can apply daily-triage preset and export with one action
- [x] AC2: Preset sets deterministic filters and output format
- [x] AC3: Preset can be edited or disabled locally
