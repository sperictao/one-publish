## Context

Cargo provider exists (TASK-0202). Next we add a Go provider to compile a spec into an execution plan.

## Goals

- Add provider id `go` with a manifest.
- Compile a minimal `go` spec into one `go build` step.

## Non-Goals

- Full module/workspace detection.
- Cross-compilation matrix.

## Requirements

- R1: `provider_id = "go"` resolves.
- R2: Compiling a go spec produces a single step `go.build`.

## TDD Plan

- [ ] Registry resolves `go`.
- [ ] Compiler produces `go.build` for go specs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` passes.
