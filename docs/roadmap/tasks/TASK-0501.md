# TASK-0501: Updater Config Visibility + Quick Open

Status: done
Owner: OpenClaw

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Updater pipeline is functional, but users still need faster diagnostics when update checks fail due to missing configuration.

## Goals

- Show updater config health directly in Settings
- Provide one-click open to setup guide and template file
- Keep behavior safe when running outside source workspace

## Non-Goals

- Editing updater config in-app
- Managing keys or endpoints in GUI forms

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to know whether updater is configured without reading logs.
- As a user, I want to open setup docs and template file directly from Settings.

## Requirements

### Functional

- R1: Add backend command to return updater config health status
- R2: Add backend command to resolve help file/template paths and open them
- R3: Show config health in Settings > Version Info
- R4: Show resolved file paths and quick-open buttons when updater is not configured

### Non-Functional

- N1: No destructive filesystem operations
- N2: Graceful fallback message when paths cannot be resolved

## Technical Design

- Rust commands:
  - `get_updater_config_health`
  - `get_updater_help_paths`
  - `open_updater_help`
- Frontend:
  - Extend `store` API contracts
  - Render config health + path hints + open actions in `SettingsDialog`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Users can see updater config status in Settings
- [x] AC2: Users can open updater setup guide from Settings
- [x] AC3: Users can open updater template config from Settings
- [x] AC4: Typecheck/tests pass
