- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Provider/status/keyword filters are in place, but triage sessions still need quick recency slicing to focus on newly introduced failures.

## Goals

- Add timeline filter for recent windows (`24h`/`7d`/`30d`)
- Keep history and failure-group views consistent under time filtering
- Keep filter reset behavior simple and deterministic

## Non-Goals

- Arbitrary date-range picker
- Server-side filtering or remote analytics

## Delivered

- Added time-window filter control in history filter bar
  - supports all/24h/7d/30d options
  - combines with existing provider/status/keyword filters
- Extended history filtering pipeline
  - applies finishedAt timestamp cutoff before keyword match
  - reuses filtered timeline as source for failure-group aggregation
- Updated clear-filter action
  - resets provider/status/window/keyword in one click
  - keeps existing UX and default behavior unchanged

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can filter history by recent 24h/7d/30d windows
- [x] AC2: Time-window filter composes with provider/status/keyword filters
- [x] AC3: Failure-group diagnostics reflect the same filtered scope
