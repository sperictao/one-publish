Status: done

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Generic execution currently collects output after process exits. For long-running commands, users need real-time visibility and the ability to cancel.

## Goals

- Stream stdout/stderr incrementally to frontend
- Add cancel action for current execution session

## Non-Goals

- Multi-process orchestration UI
- Historical log persistence in this task

## Delivered

- Added backend runtime execution slot with active process tracking
  - keeps the current running publish process handle
  - supports cooperative cancel signal + process kill
- Added publish log streaming event channel (`provider-publish-log`)
  - emits command line and incremental stdout/stderr lines during execution
  - keeps stderr lines prefixed for UI readability
- Added `cancel_provider_publish` Tauri command
  - cancels currently running publish process (if any)
  - returns explicit boolean result for UI feedback
- Extended publish result payload with `cancelled` status flag
  - cancellation returns `success=false`, `cancelled=true`, with actionable message
- Updated frontend execution UX
  - listens to streaming log events and appends log in real time
  - adds cancel button while publish is running
  - shows `成功 / 失败 / 已取消` status badge and corresponding toast feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can see real-time log chunks during execution
- [x] AC2: User can cancel running process from UI
- [x] AC3: Cancellation status is clearly reflected in result payload
