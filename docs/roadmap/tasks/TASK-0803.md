## Context

History is useful for diagnostics, but users still need to manually restore parameters for repeated runs.

## Goals

- Restore provider spec from a selected history record
- Support one-click rerun with current execution pipeline

## Non-Goals

- Batch rerun orchestration
- Cross-machine replay compatibility guarantees

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: User can restore provider + parameters from history item
- [ ] AC2: User can rerun directly from restored history item
- [ ] AC3: Rerun result is appended as a new history record
