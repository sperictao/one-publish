## Context

History is useful for diagnostics, but users still need to manually restore parameters for repeated runs.

## Goals

- Restore provider spec from a selected history record
- Support one-click rerun with current execution pipeline

## Non-Goals

- Batch rerun orchestration
- Cross-machine replay compatibility guarantees

## Delivered

- Stored publish spec payload in each execution history record
  - record now carries the spec snapshot for replay
  - supports restoring provider/project/parameters context
- Added `重新执行` action in history card
  - restores provider context and parameters into current editor state
  - reuses existing provider execution pipeline (environment check + execute + logging)
- Re-run result automatically appends as new history record
  - keeps history timeline intact with rerun outcomes
  - preserves same success/cancel/failure status semantics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can restore provider + parameters from history item
- [x] AC2: User can rerun directly from restored history item
- [x] AC3: Rerun result is appended as a new history record
