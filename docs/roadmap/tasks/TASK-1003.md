Status: done

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Execution history is local and interactive, but weekly reporting requires portable exports.

## Goals

- Export filtered history as CSV and JSON
- Include core metadata (provider/status/timestamps/signature)
- Preserve deterministic ordering (latest-first)

## Non-Goals

- Cloud sync
- BI dashboard integration

## Delivered

- Added `导出历史` action in execution history panel
  - exports current filtered timeline (not full unfiltered history)
  - supports `.csv` and `.json` via file save dialog
- Added Tauri command `export_execution_history`
  - renders CSV with stable columns and derived status field
  - falls back to pretty JSON for structured sharing
- Added Rust unit test for CSV rendering
  - verifies header schema and status/signature row generation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can export current filtered history to CSV or JSON
- [x] AC2: Export includes success/failure fields and signature metadata
- [x] AC3: Export ordering matches UI timeline ordering
