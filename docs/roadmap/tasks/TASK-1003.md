## Context

Execution history is local and interactive, but weekly reporting requires portable exports.

## Goals

## Non-Goals

- Cloud sync
- BI dashboard integration

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: User can export current filtered history to CSV or JSON
- [ ] AC2: Export includes success/failure fields and signature metadata
- [ ] AC3: Export ordering matches UI timeline ordering
