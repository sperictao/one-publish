## Context

Successful local runs prove command viability, but teams still manually convert them into CI or script snippets.

## Goals

- Generate reusable handoff snippets from successful run records
- Support at least shell and GitHub Actions fragment outputs
- Preserve provider parameters and project path context

## Non-Goals

- Full CI pipeline authoring
- Secrets management automation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: User can generate shell snippet from successful run record
- [ ] AC2: User can generate GitHub Actions command fragment
- [ ] AC3: Generated snippets match provider/spec parameters and are copy-ready
