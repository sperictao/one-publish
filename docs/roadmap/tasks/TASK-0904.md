## Context

Successful local runs prove command viability, but teams still manually convert them into CI or script snippets.

## Goals

- Generate reusable handoff snippets from successful run records
- Support at least shell and GitHub Actions fragment outputs
- Preserve provider parameters and project path context

## Non-Goals

- Full CI pipeline authoring
- Secrets management automation

## Delivered

- Added handoff snippet utility module for successful run records
  - generates copy-ready shell snippets with provider/project/parameter context
  - generates GitHub Actions fragments with working-directory and run block
- Added handoff snippet unit tests
  - verifies command normalization, working-directory inference, and fallback command logic
- Added quick-copy actions in timeline cards for successful records
  - supports one-click copy for Shell and GHA snippets
  - reuses existing clipboard flow and success/error toasts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can generate shell snippet from successful run record
- [x] AC2: User can generate GitHub Actions command fragment
- [x] AC3: Generated snippets match provider/spec parameters and are copy-ready
