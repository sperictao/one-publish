## Context

The project needs a cross-session tracking mechanism and a consistent way to write PRDs and TDD plans per incremental task.

## Goals

- Create a durable roadmap structure under `docs/roadmap/`.
- Provide a repeatable per-task template that includes PRD decomposition and TDD plan.
- Enable future tasks to link PRs and track status across sessions.

## Non-Goals

- Introducing CI in this task.
- Adding automated tests in this task.

## User Stories

- As a maintainer, I want tasks to be tracked in-repo, so that progress survives chat sessions.
- As a contributor, I want a standard task template, so that PRDs and tests are consistent.

## Requirements

### Functional

- R1: A master plan exists describing phases and principles.
- R2: A tasks index exists listing tasks and their status.
- R3: A per-task template exists including PRD + TDD plan + acceptance criteria.

### Non-Functional

- N1: Documents are ASCII and concise.
- N2: File structure is stable.

## Technical Design

- Files:
  - `docs/roadmap/MASTER_PLAN.md`
  - `docs/roadmap/TASKS.md`
  - `docs/roadmap/tasks/TASK-TEMPLATE.md`
  - `docs/roadmap/tasks/TASK-0001.md`

## TDD Plan

No automated tests for documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: New `docs/roadmap/` folder exists with master plan and tasks index.
- [ ] AC2: Task template exists and includes PRD + TDD sections.
- [ ] AC3: TASK-0001 is present and marked doing/done with links.
