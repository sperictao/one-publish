## Context

We need a minimal end-to-end smoke check to catch "it doesn't start" regressions.
We start with renderer-level smoke (Vite dev server) first, then upgrade to a true Tauri-shell e2e when we add reliable harnessing.

## Goals

- Add Playwright test harness to the repo.
- Provide a single smoke test that can run locally and in CI.

## Non-Goals

- Full user-flow coverage.
- Full Tauri-shell automation (tracked as a follow-up once harness is stable).

## Requirements

### Functional

- R1: `pnpm e2e` runs Playwright.
- R2: Smoke test can be run locally with a running renderer.

### Non-Functional

- N1: If the dev server is not running, the smoke test is skipped with a clear message (fast feedback).

## Technical Design

- Add dev dependency `@playwright/test`.
- Add `playwright.config.ts` with testDir `tests/e2e`.
- Add `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` that loads the renderer and asserts basic UI renders.

## TDD Plan

### Test cases

- [ ] When renderer is reachable, page loads and body contains expected text.
- [ ] When renderer is not reachable, test is skipped with an actionable message.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `pnpm e2e` works (skips if renderer not running).
- [ ] AC2: Documented how to run locally.
