Status: done
Owner: OpenClaw

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

As exported artifacts grow, teams need a single index page to quickly navigate bundles, snapshots, and reports.

## Goals

- Generate local index page for diagnostics exports
- Link to bundles, snapshots, and history exports
- Include generated timestamp and lightweight summary statistics

## Non-Goals

- Hosted dashboard
- Search backend

## Delivered

- Added diagnostics index export command in Tauri backend
  - supports `md`/`markdown` and `html` output formats
  - keeps `json` export as fallback for troubleshooting
- Added markdown/html renderers for diagnostics index
  - includes generated timestamp, history/filter/failure summary counts
  - groups links by snapshots/bundles/history exports and keeps empty groups explicit
- Added clickable references for local artifacts
  - markdown uses `[label](<path>)` format to preserve local absolute paths
  - html uses escaped anchor tags for direct navigation and safer rendering
- Added frontend action in execution history panel
  - supports one-click `导出诊断索引` from current runtime export set
  - tracks recent bundle/history export outputs for index link aggregation
- Added Rust tests for diagnostics index markdown/html rendering and escaping

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can generate diagnostics index markdown/html locally
- [x] AC2: Index contains clickable references to exported files
- [x] AC3: Index summary reflects current export set metadata
