- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Teams repeatedly apply the same filter combinations during daily triage.

## Goals

- Save named filter presets for timeline and diagnostics views
- Support quick apply and overwrite/delete flows
- Persist presets locally with backward compatibility

## Non-Goals

- Cross-device sync
- Role-based preset sharing

## Delivered

- Added local history filter preset persistence utility
  - loads/saves preset list with validation and maximum limit controls
  - stores only stable filter fields (provider/status/window/keyword)
- Added preset management actions in timeline filter bar
  - supports selecting preset, saving current filters as preset, and deleting selected preset
  - keeps clear-filter action deterministic by resetting active preset state
- Added unit tests for preset persistence module
  - verifies valid preset roundtrip and malformed payload fallback behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can save current filter state as named preset
- [x] AC2: User can apply/delete preset from filter bar
- [x] AC3: Presets persist across app restarts
