# TASK-0802: One-Click Snapshot Open from Run History

Status: done
Owner: OpenClaw

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Execution snapshot export exists, but users need faster access from history entries without manual file browsing.

## Goals

- Link history entries to associated snapshot outputs
- Provide one-click open behavior from history UI

## Non-Goals

- Remote snapshot indexing
- Snapshot diffing

## Delivered

- Added history-level snapshot open capability
  - history card now provides `打开快照` action for each execution record
  - action works with explicit snapshot path or output-directory fallback lookup
- Added backend command `open_execution_snapshot`
  - opens existing snapshot directly when `snapshotPath` exists
  - falls back to latest `execution-snapshot-*.(md|json)` file in output directory
  - returns actionable errors when path/dir are missing
- Added snapshot-path backfill for history records
  - after resolving/opening snapshot by fallback, resolved path is persisted into history
  - export flow also writes snapshot path into current execution record

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: History entry can open latest snapshot file directly
- [x] AC2: Missing snapshot path shows actionable message
- [x] AC3: Behavior works across dotnet/cargo/go/java providers
