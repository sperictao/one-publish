- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Phase 8 already groups repeated failures by signature, but troubleshooting still requires hopping between cards and raw logs.

## Goals

- Add drill-down view for a selected failure signature group
- Show representative run list (latest-first) with quick context
- Provide quick-copy actions for command line and signature text

## Non-Goals

- Automatic root-cause inference
- Remote diagnostics synchronization

## Delivered

- Added failure-group drill-down state and panel in history area
  - allows selecting a failure signature group from aggregation cards
  - auto-focuses first available group and keeps selection valid when history changes
- Added grouped representative run list (latest-first)
  - groups are derived by provider + normalized signature
  - records in each group are sorted by `finishedAt` descending
- Added one-click quick-copy actions
  - supports copying failure signature from group card or detail panel
  - supports copying representative command line and per-record command line
- Preserved existing troubleshooting quick actions
  - each drill-down record can open snapshot and rerun directly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can open a group and see representative failed runs sorted by time
- [x] AC2: User can one-click copy signature and representative command line
- [x] AC3: Drill-down can open snapshot and rerun from selected representative run
