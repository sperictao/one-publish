# TASK-0603: Generic Provider Execution Pipeline (Spec/Plan-Driven)

Status: done
Owner: OpenClaw

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Backend has provider compile abstractions, but runtime execution still uses dotnet-specific `execute_publish`.

## Goals

- Build generic execute command from provider id + spec parameters
- Reuse schema rendering and execution plan model
- Keep actionable output/error reporting aligned with existing UX

## Non-Goals

- Full remote orchestration
- Multi-step distributed workflow engine

## Delivered

- Added backend command `execute_provider_publish(spec)` and migrated frontend publish入口到通用命令
- Refactored legacy `execute_publish` to build dotnet spec and复用通用执行逻辑，避免双实现漂移
- Implemented plan-driven command resolution (`compile(spec)` -> first step title -> process spawn)
- Reused provider schema renderer to convert spec parameters into runtime CLI args
- Added output inference for dotnet/cargo/go/java and preserved dotnet PublishProfile compatibility via `properties.PublishProfile`
- Updated non-dotnet UI card to支持“参数编辑 + 通用执行”并保持环境检查门禁
- Added Rust unit tests for spec conversion / command resolution / cargo output inference

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: App can execute at least dotnet/cargo/go/java via one generic command entry
- [x] AC2: Output log and failure messages remain actionable
- [x] AC3: Existing dotnet flow is migrated without regression
