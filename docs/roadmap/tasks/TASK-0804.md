# TASK-0804: Failure Signature Grouping + Quick Diagnostics

Status: done

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

As history grows, repeated failures should be grouped to reduce noise and improve troubleshooting speed.

## Goals

- Extract normalized failure signatures from execution outputs
- Group repeated failures in history diagnostics view

## Non-Goals

- AI root-cause inference
- External error reporting integrations

## Delivered

- Added normalized failure signature extraction during history record creation
  - normalizes dynamic paths/ids/numbers in error context to improve grouping stability
  - stores signature on each failed run for deterministic diagnostics aggregation
- Added grouped failure diagnostics view in run history panel
  - groups failed records by provider + failure signature
  - surfaces latest occurrence time and frequency for each signature cluster
- Added representative-run quick actions for each failure group
  - supports one-click snapshot open from grouped latest record
  - supports rerun from grouped latest record to verify fixes quickly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: Similar failures are grouped under shared signature
- [x] AC2: Group view highlights latest occurrence and frequency
- [x] AC3: User can drill down to representative run logs/snapshot
