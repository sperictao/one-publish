## Context

As history grows, repeated failures should be grouped to reduce noise and improve troubleshooting speed.

## Goals

- Extract normalized failure signatures from execution outputs
- Group repeated failures in history diagnostics view

## Non-Goals

- AI root-cause inference
- External error reporting integrations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Similar failures are grouped under shared signature
- [ ] AC2: Group view highlights latest occurrence and frequency
- [ ] AC3: User can drill down to representative run logs/snapshot
