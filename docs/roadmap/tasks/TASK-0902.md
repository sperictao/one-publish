# TASK-0902: Diagnostics Bundle Export for Failure Groups

Status: done

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

Current snapshot export is per-run. For repeated failures, users need a single bundle to share diagnostics context.

## Goals

- Export selected failure group into one diagnostics bundle
- Include signature, frequency, representative runs, and snapshot references
- Support Markdown + JSON export formats

## Non-Goals

- Cloud upload/issue tracker integration
- Automatic anonymization beyond existing normalization

## Delivered

- Added failure-group diagnostics bundle export action in drill-down panel
  - supports file dialog selection with Markdown/JSON formats
  - uses selected group context to generate deterministic bundle payload
- Added export payload schema for failure-group bundles
  - includes signature, frequency, representative record id, and representative run metadata
  - carries snapshot path and output directory hints for follow-up triage
- Added Tauri command `export_failure_group_bundle`
  - writes Markdown by custom renderer and JSON by pretty serialization
  - keeps error handling behavior consistent with existing snapshot/preflight exports
- Added Rust unit test for bundle markdown rendering
  - verifies signature/frequency fields and snapshot reference output

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: User can export one failure group as Markdown or JSON
- [x] AC2: Bundle includes signature summary + representative run metadata
- [x] AC3: Bundle references available snapshot paths for fast follow-up
