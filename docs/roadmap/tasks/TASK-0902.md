## Context

Current snapshot export is per-run. For repeated failures, users need a single bundle to share diagnostics context.

## Goals

- Export selected failure group into one diagnostics bundle
- Include signature, frequency, representative runs, and snapshot references
- Support Markdown + JSON export formats

## Non-Goals

- Cloud upload/issue tracker integration
- Automatic anonymization beyond existing normalization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: User can export one failure group as Markdown or JSON
- [ ] AC2: Bundle includes signature summary + representative run metadata
- [ ] AC3: Bundle references available snapshot paths for fast follow-up
