## Context

Rerun is convenient, but teams sometimes need a quick checklist to prevent accidental reruns on sensitive branches.

## Goals

- Add optional pre-rerun checklist gate
- Capture quick confirmations (branch/env/output target)
- Keep flow fast and dismissible for local development

## Non-Goals

- Policy engine
- Role-based authorization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: User can enable/disable pre-rerun checklist from settings
- [ ] AC2: Checklist appears before rerun and requires explicit confirmation
- [ ] AC3: Checklist state does not block existing rerun recovery logic
