## Context

A fixed 20-item timeline is useful for recency but lacks configurable visibility and retention behavior.

## Goals

- Add history filtering by provider/status/time window/signature keyword
- Expose retention settings in preferences (max records)
- Keep local storage behavior deterministic and backward-compatible

## Non-Goals

- Remote archival service
- Multi-user policy management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: User can filter timeline by provider/status and keyword
- [ ] AC2: User can configure retention limit and changes persist locally
- [ ] AC3: Retention trimming keeps latest records and does not break history actions
