# TASK-0502: Signed Release Checklist Wizard

Status: done
Owner: OpenClaw

- PR: (tbd)

## Context

OnePublish already supports environment probing, packaging/signing, and updater diagnostics, but release verification is still scattered across multiple panels. Users need a single checklist flow to confirm all signed-release gates before distribution.

## Goals

- Provide a dedicated signed release checklist dialog after successful publish
- Aggregate existing release signals: environment, publish output, package/sign results, updater health
- Offer clear guidance and quick actions for incomplete steps

## Non-Goals

- Building a new backend orchestration service for release workflows
- Persisting checklist state across app restarts
- Auto-triggering package/sign actions without explicit user clicks

## User Stories

- As a release engineer, I want one checklist view for release readiness, so I do not miss required steps.
- As a release engineer, I want signed artifact status visible next to publish output, so I can validate delivery integrity.
- As a release engineer, I want direct links to environment/settings from the checklist, so I can resolve blockers quickly.

## Requirements

### Functional

- R1: Add a checklist dialog that works as a step-by-step wizard
- R2: Show status for environment check, publish result, package result, signature result, updater config health
- R3: Add post-publish entry button to open the checklist
- R4: Reuse existing actions (environment dialog/settings) for guided fixes
- R5: Keep package/sign as explicit user actions in output log area

### Non-Functional

- N1: Reuse existing command contracts (no new backend command required)
- N2: Support zh/en copy through i18n keys
- N3: Keep logic simple and local to current publish session

## Technical Design

- New component: `src/components/release/ReleaseChecklistDialog.tsx`
  - Builds checklist steps from existing frontend state
  - Pulls updater health with existing `get_updater_config_health` command
  - Supports step navigation (`prev/next`) and status badges
- `src/components/publish/ArtifactActions.tsx`
  - Adds `onStateChange` callback so parent can consume package/sign outcomes
- `src/App.tsx`
  - Stores artifact action state in parent
  - Adds checklist entry button in publish-success section
  - Wires checklist dialog with environment/settings quick actions
- i18n updates
  - `src/i18n/zh.json`
  - `src/i18n/en.json`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1: After publish success, user can open Signed Release Checklist dialog
- [x] AC2: Checklist reflects live status of environment/publish/package/sign/updater
- [x] AC3: Checklist provides actionable navigation for missing checks
- [x] AC4: Typecheck/tests/build pass
